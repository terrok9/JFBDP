Hello! :wave: Nice to see you around!

I'm Jose Fernando Barrera De Plaza, M.A. in Economics with a high interest in Computer Science and Data Analysis.

You can find my CV on <a href="https://github.com/terrok9/terrok9.github.io/blob/c3c989061ad8aae0f456a161b1c5053afc40acc3/static/CV_JFBDP_SP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" download="CV_JFBDP_SP.pdf">this download link.</a>

I programmed this webpage for you to know me better :smile:. Hope we can work or do research together.

__For P.C. visitors only:__ May you adjust the zoom or <button onclick="openZoom()">open a new page</button>
 with an improved configuration of width and height parameters, this if you don't see my full face :joy:.
